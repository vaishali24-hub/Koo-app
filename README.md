# Koo-app
Problem Statement:  Engagement/Retention: Koo has been seeing an increase in DAU but now wants to improve upon the DAU/MAU ratio, an indication of engagement/stickiness for any social platform. Suggest 3 Product solutions for the same. Consider the following :-  ● How would you market the value proposition to a user of Koo?  ● How would you design it to increase the engagement? (Keep India/Bharat users in mind while designing. Balsamiq, Figma wireframe preferred)  ● What are the key metrics you’d measure for both the features?  ● Write a blog post announcing the launch of your Product solutions.  For the above, please state any assumptions you make.
